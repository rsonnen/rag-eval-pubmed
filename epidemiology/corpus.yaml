    name: "Graduate Epidemiology Exam"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for a graduate epidemiology methods course.
      Students must demonstrate mastery of study design principles, ability
      to identify sources of bias, understanding of when different measures
      (RR, OR, HR) are appropriate, and skill in interpreting results with
      appropriate caution about confounding and selection effects.

  public_health:
    name: "Public Health Practice Review"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for public health practitioners. They need
      to translate epidemiologic findings into actionable guidance - knowing
      what surveillance data can and cannot tell us, when outbreak findings
      justify interventions, and how to communicate risk findings to
      policymakers and the public.

    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read this paper.
      Questions need specific, verifiable answers - exact incidence rates,
      particular confidence intervals, specific study populations, exposure
      definitions that require the document.
