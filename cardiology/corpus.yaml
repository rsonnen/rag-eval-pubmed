  graduate_exam:
    name: "Graduate Cardiovascular Exam"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for a graduate cardiovascular physiology
      course. Students need to demonstrate understanding of cardiac mechanics,
      electrophysiology, and hemodynamics. They should be able to interpret
      research findings in the context of underlying pathophysiology and
      recognize how study results inform our understanding of disease mechanisms.

  clinical_review:
    name: "Cardiology Fellowship Review"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for cardiology fellows preparing for boards.
      They need to apply research to patient care - interpreting imaging and
      hemodynamic data, selecting appropriate interventions based on trial
      evidence, and recognizing which study findings apply to specific
      clinical scenarios.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read this paper.
      Questions need specific, verifiable answers - exact ejection fractions,
      particular hemodynamic values, specific outcomes that require the document.
