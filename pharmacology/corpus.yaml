  graduate_exam:
    name: "Graduate Pharmacology Exam"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for a graduate pharmacology course. Students
      need to demonstrate understanding of drug-receptor interactions,
      pharmacokinetic principles, and how mechanism of action relates to
      therapeutic and adverse effects. They should interpret research findings
      in the context of established pharmacological principles.

  clinical_review:
    name: "Clinical Pharmacology Review"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for clinical pharmacology trainees. They need
      to apply pharmacological research to prescribing decisions - understanding
      when PK/PD data support dose adjustments, recognizing clinically significant
      interactions, and interpreting therapeutic monitoring results in context
      of published evidence.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read this paper.
      Questions need specific, verifiable answers - exact drug concentrations,
      particular Ki/Kd values, specific efficacy outcomes that require the document.
