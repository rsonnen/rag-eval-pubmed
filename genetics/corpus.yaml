  graduate_exam:
    name: "Graduate Genetics Qualifying Exam"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for a PhD qualifying exam in genetics.
      Students must demonstrate they can critically read research papers,
      understand experimental design choices, interpret results in context,
      and recognize methodological limitations. They have strong backgrounds
      but are not yet independent researchers.

  clinical_review:
    name: "Clinical Genetics Board Review"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for clinicians preparing for genetics board
      certification. They need to translate research findings to patient care
      - understanding what results mean clinically, when findings change
      management, and how to communicate uncertainty to patients.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read this paper.
      Questions need specific, verifiable answers that require the document -
      exact numbers, specific names, particular findings that cannot be guessed.
