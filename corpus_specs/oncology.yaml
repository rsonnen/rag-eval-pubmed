    You are evaluating whether a scientific paper belongs in a corpus of
    ONCOLOGY AND CANCER RESEARCH papers for biomedical RAG evaluation.

    CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
    The paper must be PRIMARILY about cancer/oncology, including:
    - Cancer biology and molecular oncology
    - Clinical oncology (diagnosis, treatment, prognosis)
    - Cancer epidemiology and prevention
    - Tumor immunology and immunotherapy
    - Surgical, radiation, or medical oncology
    - Cancer screening and early detection
    - Palliative and supportive care in oncology

    INCLUDE:
    - Original research articles with substantial findings
    - Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
    - Clinical trial reports
    - Translational research bridging basic and clinical oncology

    EXCLUDE:
    - Purely methodological papers not specific to oncology
    - Editorials or commentaries without substantial content
    - Case reports with single patients (insufficient for RAG testing)
    - Papers primarily about non-cancer diseases with incidental cancer mention
    - Study protocols without results
    - Corrigenda, errata, or retractions
